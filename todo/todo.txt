TODO list:
-Finish login/created view
-Change login to the username of the logged in user in the navbar on login
-deal with possible nulls for inserting location
-fix repetition in add/update sql functions(fixed?)
-recover from deleting multiple rows in delete location function
-change modify attribute function to be more like modify location function, with extra complication of non changable attributes for user
-think of better names for login and location actions
