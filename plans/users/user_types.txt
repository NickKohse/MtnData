There are three different types of users that will be able to use the site.

Owners - Users who run the website, and can add or remove any content from it including users, comments
and destinations
Admins - Users who curate the content for a certain physical region, they can add new destinations or 
delete comments for destinations in their region.
Regular - These user can comment and add trip reports as well as add new destinations which are 'probationary'
until an admin or owner approves them. Regular users can apply to become admins, and will have to be approved
by at least three admins.

Access levels are hierarchical, i.e. owners can do what admins can, but not vice versa.
